This document uses [the official docs](https://build.fhir.org/medication-definition-module.html) as a reference.
Definitions for medication are provided by following elements:

The core elements are the following:

- [MedicinalProductDefinition](https://build.fhir.org/medicinalproductdefinition.html)

  The MedicinalProductDefinition resource covers the detailed defining data of medicinal products, to a level beyond what is typically needed for day-to-day prescribing, but that is commonly required by manufacturers and regulators, and also for use in drug catalogs and pharmacopoeias. (For direct patient care when prescribing, dispensing etc. the correct resource is [Medication](https://build.fhir.org/medication.html)).

* [PackagedProductDefinition](https://build.fhir.org/packagedproductdefinition.html)

  The PackagedProductDefinition resource represents one pack type of a product, and can also capture all aspects of the physical packaging of a product. These pack types can be associated with an "owning" MedicinalProductDefinition, to represent the range of different pack sizes for that product. These may have different legal statuses and availability, or be packaged in different ways. The resource allows describing which drug items and associated co-packaged devices are within them. The actual contained items are handled by specific resources (e.g. [ManufacturedItemDefinition](https://build.fhir.org/manufactureditemdefinition.html) and [DeviceDefinition](https://build.fhir.org/devicedefinition.html)).

- [ManufacturedItemDefinition](https://build.fhir.org/manufactureditemdefinition.html)

  ManufacturedItemDefinition is used when you need to describe a physical medication item type such as a tablet or capsule, or some continuous substance such as liquid or powder. This is typically for regulatory or manufacturing use cases, rather than day-to-day prescribing or dispensing. It can carry the definition and characteristics of a medicinal (or medically-related) manufactured item, usually to be contained in a [packaged medicinal product](https://build.fhir.org/packagedproductdefinition.html), and not found on its own. The package definition carries the quantity of each contained item, allowing re-use for different amounts

- [AdministrableProductDefinition](https://build.fhir.org/administrableproductdefinition.html)

  A medicinal product may consist of several items, which need to be combined before administration to the patient. The administrable (or "pharmaceutical") product - which differs in that it is now "mixed" from its components (if necessary) and is ready for use - is covered by the AdministrableProductDefinition resource. The components are ManufacturedItemDefinitions.

Next to these base objects there are supporting objects that might be useful to map.
- [Organization](https://build.fhir.org/organization.html)

  Many regulatory processes are centred around organizations (pharma companies, drug manufacturers, regulatory agencies). These are all represented by Organizations, and are referenced by many of the module's resources.

## The path forward
**MedicinalProductDefinition** looks like it is one of the more useful items to actually map. The issue is that I'm not really sure at this moment what level maps here the best. At first glance this looks to be the **AMP**-level.

**PackagedProductDefinition** is pretty forward. In SamV2 this is the AMPP level. The identifier can be the CTI-extended.

**Organization** looks straightforward as well.
